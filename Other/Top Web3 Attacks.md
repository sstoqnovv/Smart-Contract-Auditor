### Unraveling the Top Attack Vectors

Lets consider the weakest parts of Web3 and remind everyone with the **“Top Attack Vectors.”**  

1. **Private Keys** - Stolen Private Keys are responsible for the largest loss of funds so far in 2023 at `$243,000,000`
2. **Reward Manipulation** – This vector involves the manipulation of decentralized incentive systems that could disrupt the balance and fairness within a network. `$200,000,000` has been rugged so far this year.
3. **Price Oracle Manipulation** – This threat arises when a price oracle in centralized, or if a single oracle is relied upon, particularly with respect to price data. These vulnerabilities are responsible for `~$146,000,000` in losses in 2023.
4. **Insufficient Access Controls** – onlyOwner modifiers, multi-sig wallets - just a couple things that could have preventing `$17,000,000` in stolen funds this year.
5. **Re-entrancy(and Read-Only Re-entrancy)** - by not adhering to proper Checks, Effects, Interactions patterns - protocols are still being rekt to the tune of `$20,500,000` combined in 2023.
