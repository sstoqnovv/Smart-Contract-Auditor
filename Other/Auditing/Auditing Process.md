1. Go through the Code line-by-line & Read the Docs and making sure the code actually does what's supposed to do.
2. Understand what the protocol should do. 
	 - Most bugs are actually business logic issues and the only way you'll know if business logic is wrong is if you understand what the protocol or the business should do.
	 - Repetition is the mother of skills - the more you read code, the more you read docs, the more you do this audits - the better you'll get.

How I manage my day-to-day tasks as a smart contract security researcher in 3 steps !:

**Step1.** Listing Tasks: I start by enumerating all the tasks that need to be completed today, for example: 
1/ Write 2 tweets 2/ Audit 150 SLOC of your current private audit 3/ Read 3 audit reports and analyze the attack vectors of the bugs ... 

**Step 2.** Prioritization: After listing the tasks, I prioritize them. Tasks requiring completion by lunchtime take precedence. For instance, submitting a report might fall into this category. On the other hand, tasks like reviewing past reports can be deferred until the evening. 

**Step 3.** Task Tracking: As I complete each task, I mark it as 'completed.' This not only provides a sense of accomplishment but also keeps my mind clear. Additionally, having a written workflow enhances organization and overall productivity. Be organised and get things done on time, make that a habit and you will be way more successful.
