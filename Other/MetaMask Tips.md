In Metamask multiple accounts have the same seed phrase and if someone knows your seed phrase - it has the multiple accounts. But any account has individual unique private key.

### What is a ‘Secret Recovery Phrase’ and how to keep your crypto wallet secure

Your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) is a unique 12-word phrase that is generated when you first set up MetaMask. Your funds are connected to that phrase. If you ever lose your password, your SRP allows you to recover your wallet and your funds. Write it down on paper and hide it somewhere, put it in a safety deposit box, or use a secure password manager. Some users even engrave their phrases into metal plates! (Storing your SRP in a physical, offline format eliminates the risk of hacking.)

#### Warning!
If you lose your Secret Recovery Phrase _and_ forget your password, there is no way to recover the phrase and access your account.

### Don't share your SRP and private key
This has been mentioned already, but it doesn’t hurt to be thorough: anyone who has your SRP or private keys can remove tokens from your accounts. Never share your SRP or private keys with anyone — not even the MetaMask team, even though we will **never** ask you for this information.
