**The Rekt Test** is highly important as it poses a set of questions to gauge your protocol's preparedness for an audit. This tool forces you to think about security measures from a more proactive angle. Should your protocols fail to answer these questions, the chances are that they're not audit-ready.

As developers, you must be able to answer all these queries before you proceed with an audit. If you're dealing with a protocol that fails to answer these questions, it's best to tell them the protocol isn't ready to ship, or arguably audit, until they can.
