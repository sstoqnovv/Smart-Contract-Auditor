**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):** These are _**any group that is governed by a transparent set of rules found on a blockchain or smart contract.**_

It's not entirely accurate, but an easy way to think about a DAO is like a big company where all the actions of the company are decided upon by Immutable, Transparent, Decentralized voting mechanisms.**_

It's a governance structure without a central authority which rewards good behavior and penalizes bad behavior by a set of pre-defined rules which can only be changes by a vote, which typically requires a stake, adding risk to the processto discourage bad actors, amongst the participants.

### DAO Architecture

Let's look a little closer at the properties of a DAO that allow them to function.

**Voting Mechanism**

This is the means by which a community engages with the protocol and contributes to the decisions being made. This is a fundamental part of how a DAO functions.

One consideration that must be made is: **How do we identify stakeholders, or members of the community, eligible to vote?**

Often this is handled via an ERC20 or an NFT of some kind, but this runs the risk of being _less_ fair if the tokens are more available to the wealthy than others. This is not dissimilar to Web2 companies and how the voting power of company shares works.

One methodology is the "Skin in the Game" method whereby voting records are recording and negative outcomes result in tokens/voting power being lost. This is beneficial in that it holds users accountable for the decisions they make. A downside to this approach is how difficult it can be to reach a concensus on what a _bad_ outcome is.

A third approach is something called "Proof of Personhood Participation" and while potentially ideal, isn't something with a sound implementation yet. The idea would be a method by which someone can be verified as being a single human entity, but the logics of this are difficult and rub up against anonymity. Some projects like WorldCoin are trying to find solutions here!
