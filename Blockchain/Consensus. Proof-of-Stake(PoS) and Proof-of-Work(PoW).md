**Consensus Mechanisms:** Nodes in a blockchain network work together to achieve consensus on the state of the blockchain. Different blockchain networks use various consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, or other algorithms to ensure agreement among nodes.

**Consensus Algorithm** - A protocol used to ensure that all nodes in a blockchain network agree on the validity of transactions and the state of the ledger.
****
**Proof-of-Work (PoW)** and **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** are two consensus mechanisms used by blockchain networks to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.

- **Proof-of-Work (PoW):** Miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles using computational power. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets the right to add a new block to the blockchain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency. This method is resource-intensive because it requires significant energy and computational power, as many miners race to solve the puzzle.
    
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS):** Proof-of-stake is a way to prove that validators have put something of value into the network that can be destroyed if they act dishonestly. Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they "stake" or lock up as collateral. Validators are more likely to be chosen to validate a new block if they have a larger stake. PoS is less resource-intensive than PoW because it does not rely on solving complex puzzles and therefore uses less energy. 
	Validators create and validate blocks based on their stakes. If a validator creates a malicious block or attempts an attack, they risk losing their staked cryptocurrency.

**Mining** -  the process of verifying a transactionans writing it to the blockchain for which the successful miner is rewarded in the cryptocurrency of the blockchain.
The process of finding the "solution" to the blockchain "problem". Nodes get paid for minig blocks.

**Miners/Validators** - entities running Ethereum nodes that validate and execute these transactions and combine them into blocks. They are rewarded for blocks accepted into the blockchain. It uses PoW.

### Differences between PoW and PoS:

1. **Resource Usage:**
    - PoW relies on computational power and energy consumption to solve puzzles. PoS relies on participants holding and locking up cryptocurrency as collateral.
2. **Selection of Block Validators:**
    - PoW selects validators (miners) based on their ability to solve complex mathematical problems. PoS selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to stake.
3. **Security Model:**
    - PoW achieves security through the computational power expended by miners. PoS achieves security by making malicious behavior economically costly for validators.
