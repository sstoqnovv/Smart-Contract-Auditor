**Web3:** It represents a set of principles and technologies aimed at creating a more decentralized, open, and user-centric internet. Main focus on blockchain technology and decentralized protocols.

**Decentralization** - Having no single point of authority. No needs for intermediaries.

**Nonce** - A "number used once" to find the "solution" to the blockchain problem.

**Node** -  computer in the network/participant in a decentralized network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions. Nodes communicate with each other to reach consensus on the state of the blockchain. Connecting to a node allows you to read blockchain data and/or send transactions to the network. They collectively store the state of the Ethereum blockchain and reach consensus on transactions to mutate the blockchain state. It has many types of nodes:

**Hash** - unique fixed length string, meant to identify a piece of data. They are created by placing data into a hash function. Ethereum use `keccak256()` for its hashing algorithm. 
`Data: Stivan - Hash: 6cbb83463928ddjs87...`

**Hash Algorithm** - A function that computes data into a unique hash

**Peer-to-Peer(P2P)** - communication between nodes

**Address** - location to or from which transactions occur on the blockchain.

**Wallet** - A digital file that holds coins and tokens held by the owner. The wallet also has a blockchain address to which transactions can be sent.

**Fork** - A collectively agreed upon software update by all nodes in a distributed network.

**Mainnet(main newtwork)** - The main public Ethereum blockchain. The production version of a blockchain. There are other Ethereum testnets(Goerli, Sepolia, Konan, Rinkeby). **Mainnet uses real ETH, testnets use ETH that can be obtained from faucets.**

**Mempool** - a queue where unconfirmed blockchain transactions are stored

**Seed Phrase** - A random sequence of words which can be used to restore a lost wallet.

**Audits(Security Review)** - involve a thorough examination and evaluation of the code and functionalities of a smart contract to ensure its security, reliability, and compliance with best practices. It is a code review to identify vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity and safety of the code looking for issues as: logic errors, assesments, code quality, best practices, external dependencies, etc. Smart contract audits are typically performed by specialized blockchain security firms or independent auditors with expertise in the programming languages and technologies relevant to the smart contract being examined.

**Liquidity** - The ease of converting an asset (or, in this case, cryptocurrency) to cash (fiat).

**Ethereum Improvement Proposal(EIP)** - It is a formal design document that proposes changes, improvements, or new features(core protocol specifiactions, client API, etc.) to the Ethereum blockchain.

**Capture The Flag(CTFs)** - competitions/challenges designed to test participant skills for security. They're engaging and practical way to learn and enhance cypersecurity skills.

**Total Value Locked (TVL)** refers to the total amount of assets or capital locked in a particular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol or smart contract
