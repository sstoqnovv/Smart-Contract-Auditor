NFT stands for "Non-Fungible Token." It is a type of digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content using blockchain technology. NFTs have gained significant popularity, especially in the world of digital art, collectibles, and gaming. NFTs cannot be exchanged. Each NFT has distinct attributes that make it different from any other token.
NFTs represent ownership or proof of authenticity for digital or physical items, often in the form of digital art, music, videos, virtual real estate, in-game items, or other digital assets.
NFTs are often created and managed using smart contracts, self-executing code on the blockchain. Smart contracts define the rules for the creation, ownership, and transfer of NFTs.
Common token standards, such as **ERC-721** (for individual, non-fungible tokens) and **ERC-1155** (for both fungible and non-fungible tokens), are used in the creation of NFTs.

**Proof of Authenticity** refers to a verification process or evidence demonstrating the genuine origin, source, or legitimacy of a particular item, piece of content, or digital asset. It ensures that the item is not counterfeit, altered, or falsely represented. The concept is relevant in various domains, including art, collectibles, documents, and digital media.

**Example:** A piece of art(painting) like Mona Lisa is much more valueable than its copies. It's a certificate for authencity.

**NFT Creation** - Create a digital good(image, video, etc.). Create a token on a Smart Contract blockchain(like Ethereum). This token contain info about the digital goods that are being sold. This info includes token, name, token symbol, unique hash that proves the authencity of the NFT.

**Decentralized Marketplace** - OpenSea. You need a wallet(e.g. Metamask).
