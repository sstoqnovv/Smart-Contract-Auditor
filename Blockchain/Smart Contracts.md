**Smart contracts** - trust minimized agreements/set of instrucitons executed in a decentralized way without the need for a cenetralized or third party intermediary. They're like traditional contracts, but instead of writing in Word document - they're writed in code.

These are self-executing programs with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into code. Smart contracts run on blockchain platforms and automatically execute when predefined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.

Everything that happens with them happens in their little world, but if they're going to be these agreements they need external data and computation and this is by Oracle. After deployment smart contracts are **immutable**.
The deployed contract can be modified, the functionality can be modified in 3 ways:
 - The contract can be modified and re-deployed at a new address, but you have to carry over all the state
 - **Proxy contract** - can be upgraded
 - **CREATE2 opcode** - allows updating a contract in place had the same address using the same unit code.

**Purpose of Smart Contracts** - Nearly everything you do in life is the result of an agreement or a contract. Your chair was the result of an agreement. Smart contracts are an agreement, contract, or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain.They cannot be altered(immutable), automatically executes, everyone sees the terms of the agreement(open-source). Smart contracts are in a decentralized blockchain and used in combination with a decentralized Oracle Network to get the real world assets. Smart Contracts are minimizing the trust we need to give other people order for these agreements to be executed(Unbreakable  Promises).

Let's say we have supporters of a project and they transfer their money to the smart contract. If the project gets fully funded, the contract automatically passes the money to the creator of the project. If the project fails to meet the goal, the money automatically goes back to the supporters.
And because smart contract are stored on a blockchain, everything is completely **distributed**(means that the output of your contract is validated by everyone on the network. So a single person cannot force the contracts to release the funds because other people on the network will spot this attempt and mark it as invalid). With this technique, no one is in control of the money.
