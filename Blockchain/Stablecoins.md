**Stablecoins** are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, like a fiat currency (e.g., US Dollar), a commodity (e.g., gold), or a basket of assets. They aim to combine the benefits of cryptocurrency—like fast, secure, and borderless transactions—with the stability of traditional currencies, which are less volatile compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Tether, USDC, BUSD are pegged to US dollar. They are fiat-collateralized stablecoins.

> Pegged stablecoins have their value tied to another asset. Floating stablecoins use math and other mechanisms to maintain a constant buying power.

**Algorithmic Stablecoins (Non-Collateralized)**

- These stablecoins are not backed by any collateral. Instead, they rely on algorithms and smart contracts to manage the supply of the stablecoin to maintain a stable price.
- The system typically increases or decreases the supply of the stablecoin based on demand, similar to how central banks manage the money supply to maintain price stability.
