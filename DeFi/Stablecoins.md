**Stablecoin is like a digital currency, but with a stable value.**
Stablecoins are crypto assets that aim to keep their price “pegged” to the market value of an external asset such as fiat currency or commodity.

> DAI and USDC are assets that are USD derivatives, and stETH, WBTC are pegged to ETH and BTC assets.

**Why Stable?** Regular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can have prices that go up and down a lot(volatility). Stablecoins are designed to avoid this, so 1 stablecoin today is still close to 1 stablecoin tomorrow. Because stablecoins stay at a steady value, people use them for everyday digital payments, like buying things online. They're also handy for moving money across borders or trading in the world of cryptocurrencies. They are less risky.

These stablecoins are backed by traditional fiat currencies like the US Dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen. Issuers hold a reserve of the fiat currency in a bank account for each unit of stablecoin in circulation. Popular examples include USDC (USD Coin), Tether (USDT), and TrueUSD (TUSD).
