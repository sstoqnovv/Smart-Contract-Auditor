**Decentralized Finance(DeFi)** - used to describe a set of financial services and applications that operate on decentralized blockchain platforms. The goal of DeFi is to recreate and improve upon traditional financial systems, such as banking and lending, using blockchain technology while removing the need for traditional intermediaries like banks and financial institutions. It allows for decentralized and truthless financial transactions.

DeFi platforms offer lending and borrowing services where users can lend their cryptocurrency assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral. These transactions are facilitated by smart contracts, which automate the lending and borrowing process.
It is a system of financial applications and services built on blockchain technology that enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries.

In the DeFi economy, users can access a similar financial application stack as they would in traditional finance but without requiring the involvement of centralized intermediaries.

**dApp = Decentralized Application = Decentralized Protocol = Smart Contracts**.
It is a software which does not rely on a central system or database but can share information amongst its users via a decentralized database, such as a blockchain. It's a an app built on a decentralized network that combines a smart contract and a front-end UI. It's a open-source.

### How Does DeFi Work?

The global economy today operates on disparate systems that entrust significant amounts of capital and arbitration to large, centralized financial institutions.
On the other hand, public blockchain infrastructure is rooted in the open-source movement, where anyone with an Internet connection can access a global, decentralized, and peer-to-peer financial system without ever needing to entrust a custodian with their assets.

**Derivatives** are contracts that derive their value from performance of an underlying asset, index, rate, or other reference.

**Levarage** - strategy of using borrowed money to increase the potential return of an investment

**DeFi Protocol** - blockchain-based financial systems that aim to recreate and innovate traditional financial services in a decentralized, permissionless, and open-source manner, that enables various financial activities without the need for intermediaries. It aim to privide open, transparent, permissionless financial service.

Here are some common types of DeFi protocols:

1. **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):** Platforms like Uniswap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with one another without relying on a centralized authority.
2. **Lending and Borrowing Platforms:** Protocols like Compound, Aave, and MakerDAO enable users to lend their cryptocurrencies to earn interest or borrow assets by using their cryptocurrency as collateral.
3. **Stablecoins:** Stablecoins like DAI, USDC, and USDT are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by pegging their value to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. They are often used for trading and as a stable store of value in DeFi.
4. **Automated Market Makers (AMMs):** These are protocols that facilitate liquidity provision for decentralized exchanges. Uniswap is a notable example, where users provide liquidity to pools, and smart contracts automatically determine token prices.
5. **Yield Farming Platforms:** Platforms like Yearn Finance and Curve Finance allow users to optimize their returns by automatically moving their funds between different liquidity pools or yield farming strategies.
6. **Insurance Protocols:** Projects like Nexus Mutual and Cover offer decentralized insurance services, allowing users to protect themselves against smart contract vulnerabilities or hacks.
7. **Oracles:** Oracle networks like Chainlink provide decentralized and reliable data feeds to smart contracts. They act as bridges between blockchain networks and real-world data, supporting the execution of various DeFi applications.
8. **Tokenization Platforms:** Platforms like Synthetix enable the creation of synthetic assets or tokens that represent the value of real-world assets like commodities, stocks, or fiat currencies.
