You wan't to buy a car, but it's too expensive? You do it anyways? Good. But you need to have to get a loan from the bank. You tell them that they have the title of the car until you pay off that loan. If you don't pay the loan, they will get your car.
Money come from the bank and they lend to you, knowing that you will pay high interest on it.

AAVE is decentralized financial app, that allows people to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies in turn for getting and paying fees. It's all anonymous too. 

AAVE used a peer to smart contract method. Lenders can deposit money into a SC and earn interest and also borrowers could deposit their collateral into another SC and borrow from any SC they wanted to borrow from.

#### Lending Returns

You lend your crypto to AAVE and they pay interest on it.
After you deposit some of your crypto to AAVE to earn interest, you can also decide to borrow against it.

#### Overcollateralized Loans

Whenever you borrowed the 80% of your house to make payments on it, the house collateral, which means that if you couldn't pay the loan back, the bank would just kick you out and take your house.(ипотека). 

But if you want to borrow crypto, you have to be overcollateralized. This means, if you want to borrow a 100 dollars, you must give the bank 120 dollars. This might be crazy, but it's true. Let's see why:

**Imagine this:** If a gave you 100 dollars worth of ETH and you lent me 80 worth of TETH(stablecoin pegged to the US dollar). You use that 80 dollars for a few months and then you decide to pay it back and get your ETH. Well, by then ETH has doubled it's price and so you cash out your 100 of ETH, but you actually get 200 dollars worth of value, becuase ETH has raised in price.

AAVE SOLVES THIS BY...

**Imagine:** You put 100 dollars of ETH and what is called maximum loan to value of ETH is 80%, which means, you can borrow 80% of that 100 dollars. So, you decide to borrow 80 dollars of TETHER. Well, if that ETH price drops to more 82.5% of its value, which is the liquidation percentage, AAVE will automatically take your ETH and pay back the lender. However, you get to keep that 80 that you borrowed 

#### Paying back loans

**Official AAVE website says:** There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan, unlike the traditional loans. As long as your position is safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. However, they say as time passes the accured interest will grow, making your health factor decrease which might result in your deposited assets becoming more likely to be liquidated.
