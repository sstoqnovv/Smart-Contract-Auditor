**Uniswap** - Decentralized permissionless exchange(DEX). Allows trading of ERC-20 tokens.

**In V1** - Allows traders on the Ethereum network to use a new system of trading - AMM to allow traders to trade with a pool of money at any point in time with very low fees and they could trade for an infinite amount of coins.

**V2** - creating pools that don't need Ethereum. While Uniswap V1 primarily supported swaps between Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, Uniswap V2 extended this functionality to enable direct swaps between two ERC-20 tokens without the need for an intermediary step. 
Uniswap V2 continued to operate on the automated market maker (AMM) model. Users could provide liquidity to pools by depositing token pairs in a predefined ratio, and the protocol automatically determined token prices based on the available liquidity.
Uniswap V2 introduced flash swaps, allowing users to borrow tokens without collateral within a single transaction. However, this feature comes with the requirement that the borrowed tokens must be returned by the end of the transaction, ensuring the integrity of the protocol.
Uniswap V2 incorporated improvements in the price oracle, the mechanism that determines the price of assets within the protocol.
Uniswap V2 introduced the **UNI governance token**, which was distributed to users who interacted with the protocol, including liquidity providers and users of the platform.

**V3** - third iteration of the Uniswap DEX protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed to provide increased capital efficiency and flexibility compared to its previous versions.
The key features introduced in V3:
 - **Concentrated Liquidity** - liquidity providers are allowed to concentrate their liquidity within a spceific price range.
 - **Multiple fee** - liquidity providres can choose the fee tier to participate in, with each tier having a different fee %
 - **Non-Fungible Liquidity** - V3 represents liquidity positions as non-fungible tokens called "liquidity tokens"
