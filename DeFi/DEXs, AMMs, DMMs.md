**Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)** are an essential part of the DeFi ecosystem. They are powered by smart contracts on blockchains and allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without a centralized third party. There are two common types of DEXs: **order book DEXs** and **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**. AMMs use liquidity pools to determine prices based on asset ratios in the pool.

DEX users must pay two types of fees:

1. **Network fees** – gas costs for blockchain transactions.
2. **Trading fees** – fees collected by the protocol, liquidity providers, or token holders.

In summary, DEXs allow peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading without intermediaries, often using AMMs and liquidity pools for efficient transactions.

**Uniswap** - DEX. Allows trading of ERC-20 tokens. Uniswap is the largest DEX today. 
**Unitoken** - governance token. Allows whoever holds it to influence and vote for development decisions. The more tokens you hold, the more voting power you have. 

A subset of DEXs called Automated Market Makers (AMM).

**Automated Market Makers (AMMs)** are decentralized exchange mechanisms that use liquidity pools to facilitate trading of assets, like cryptocurrencies, without the need for traditional order books. Users provide two assets to a pool, and the price of each asset is determined by the ratio of the two assets in the pool, which shifts when trades are made. When someone trades, they interact directly with the pool, which adjusts the asset prices based on supply and demand.

AMMs remove the need for buyers and sellers to find each other directly by automating price discovery.

**Decentralized Money Markets** are platforms that allow users to borrow and lend digital assets using blockchain-based smart contracts, without relying on intermediaries or custodians. These markets, like traditional money markets, connect borrowers and lenders. However, they are decentralized and governed by open-source code, with community governance through distributed stakeholders.

Examples of decentralized money markets include platforms like **AAVE** and **Compound**:

- **aTokens** are ERC-20 tokens minted by AAVE to represent a user's share in the lending pool and are automatically burned when assets are withdrawn.
- **cTokens** are used in Compound to represent a user’s supplied assets, and their value is based on an exchange rate, which fluctuates over time as interest accrues.

In summary, decentralized money markets enable permissionless borrowing and lending using smart contracts, governed by communities rather than central authorities.
