**Chainlink** is a decentralized blockchain oracle network built on Ethereum. The network is intended to be used to facilitate the transfer of tamper-proof data from off-chain sources to on-chain smart contracts.

### Chainlink Verifiable Random Function(VRF)

Chainlink Verifiable Random Function, is a service provided by the Chainlink decentralized oracle network. It is designed to bring secure and tamper-proof randomness to smart contracts on blockchain platforms.

Randomness is a critical component in many dApps and SC. Generating truly random numbers in a decentralized and trustless manner is challenging. 
Chainlink VRF addresses this challenge by leveraging a network of decentralized oracle nodes to generate and deliver provably random numbers.
Chainlink VRF generate a random number and cryptographic proof of how that number was determined using an unpredictable combination of block data.

### Chainlink Price Feeds

 **Chainlink** - Decentralized oracle network and framework that aims to connect SC with real-world data and external APIs.
- SC can make requests to Chainlink oracles to obtain real-time data such as: *market prices, weather conditions, sports scores...
- The oracles fetch the requested data and deliver it back to the SC in a secure manner.
- Chainlink network operates on a token economy using the LINK token.
- Chainlink solves the Oracle problem (oracles must provide accurate data)
 
**Opcodes** - interact with areas of storage, memory stack; specific instruction to give to the EVM to do something
 
Chainlink solves the Oracle problem(oracles must provide accurate data)
 
**Price Feeds** - provide data that is aggregated(обединена) from many data sources(like Data providers) by a decentralized set of independent node operators. They give the aggregated info into a transaction called "Reference Contract".
