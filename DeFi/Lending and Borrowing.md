**Lending and Borrowing** - Lending and borrowing are fundamental concepts in the world of finance and are also integral components of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.
Most people in their life are exposed to borrowing usually by taking a car or student loan or a mortgage.

**Lending** - In traditional finance, lending involves providing funds to individuals.

**Borrowing**, on the other hand, is the process of obtaining funds from lenders with the agreement to repay the borrowed amount along with interest. Borrowers may use loans for various purposes, such as buying a home, starting a business, or covering personal expenses.

`Lenders(Depositors) provide funds for borrowers in return for interest on their deposit. Borrowers(loantakers) are willing to pay interest on the amount they borrowed in exchange.`

**Lending pools** are smart contracts(e.g. AAVE) where user deposit assets(usually ERC-20 tokens) to lend and borrow against collateral asset.

Lend tokens to receive interest. Borrow tokens to conduct other activities while paying interest.
Borrowers have to provide collateral that is stored in smart contract within the DeFi system, which can be liquidated either by the lender or by other market participants if the borrower doesn't meet repayment schedule deadlines.

**Share Tokens**(e.g. aToken, cToken, eToken) are tokens that represent user's share in a lending pool. These tokens occur interest over time and are minted and burned to adjust for users' deposit and withdrawals.
