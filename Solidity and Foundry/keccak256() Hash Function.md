**keccak256()** - cryptographic hash function/algorithm.

It is a member of the SHA-3 family of hash functions and is designed to be secure against various types of attacks, including preimage attacks, collision attacks, and length extension attacks.

In Solidity, the `keccak256` function takes an arbitrary length of input data and produces a 256-bit (32 bytes) hash output. This hash output is a fixed-size value that is unique for each unique input.

Here's an example of how to use the `keccak256` function in Solidity:
```php
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HashExample {
    function getHash(string memory _input) public pure returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encode(_input));
    }
}
```
The `keccak256` function is particularly useful in smart contracts for generating unique identifiers, verifying data integrity, and creating secure applications that guarantee immutability.
