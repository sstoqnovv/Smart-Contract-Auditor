**Mapping syntax** ->`mapping(_keyType => _ValueType)` - basically like a dictionary(key-value pair).

Mappings can only have a data location of `storage` and thus are allowed for state variables, as storage reference types in functions, or as parameters for library functions.

The similarity ends there, the key data is not stored in a mapping, only its `keccak256` hash is used to look up the value.

contract MappingExample {

    mapping (address => uint256) private _balances; // represents a balance of each address
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) private _allowances;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);

    function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view returns (uint256) {
        return _allowances[owner][spender];
    }

    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        _transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
        approve(sender, msg.sender, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        require(owner != address(0), "ERC20: approve from the zero address");
        require(spender != address(0), "ERC20: approve to the zero address");

        _allowances[owner][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(owner, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(sender != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
        require(recipient != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");

        _balances[sender] -= amount;
        _balances[recipient] += amount;
        emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    }
}
```

Here in `_balances` mapping, let's say it is: `Michael => 500`. It means that Michael has 500 dollars.
